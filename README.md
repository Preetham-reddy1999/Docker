# 🚀 Personal Docker Project

This repository contains my personal Docker project where I containerized a sample application using Docker. It serves as a practical demonstration of Docker fundamentals including Dockerfile creation, image building, and container execution.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- ✅ Created a Dockerfile to containerize a basic web application (e.g., Django, Flask, Node.js, etc.)
- ✅ Built and ran Docker images locally
- ✅ Used Docker Hub to push and pull custom images
- ✅ Explored volume mapping, port binding, and container networking

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Docker Desktop**
- *(Optional: Docker Compose, Python/Django, Node.js, Nginx, etc.)*
- **Git & GitHub**
- **VS Code / Terminal**

## 📄 Getting Started

To run the container locally:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd <repo-name>
